# XDG menu addon for Kodi

This script lets you browse a menu of applications installed on your system,
and launch any of these applications directly from Kodi.

It only works on Linux with the XDG Python libraries installed.

Requires [PyXDG](https://github.com/Rudd-O/script.module.pyxdg).

## Installation

1. `git clone` the PyXDG repo (linked above) in your `~/.kodi/addons` folder.
2. `git clone` the repo containing this document in your `~/.kodi/addons` folder.
3. Restart Kodi.

You should be asked to activate the *Applications* or *XDG menu* addon.
Confirm.

Now you should have the *Applications* program addon available.
